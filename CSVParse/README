Explanation: 

This is a very primitive example of our goal, it uses nodeJS express to open localhost:3000 to run a html that get it's content filled with a CSV
Why? If only the HTML is run there are CORS problems which block the HTML from reading the CSV

Usage: 
- Download the CSVParse folder 

- Make sure you have nodeJS

- Open a terminal in the CSVParse directory 

- Prepare the node Modules and package run the following code:
    - npm init -y
    - npm install express

- Run the command: node srvr.js

- Click the link in the terminal
